And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \\n\\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \\n\\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \\n\\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.', metadata={'source': '31'}),\n",

Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. \\n\\nAnd if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. \\n\\nWe can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.  \\n\\nWe’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  \\n\\nWe’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. \\n\\nWe’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.', metadata={'source': '32'}),\n",

I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. \\n\\nAnd soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago.

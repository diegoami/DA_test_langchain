By contrast,\\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\\nsoftware for all its users.\\n\\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\\n\\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\\nand/or modify the software.\\n\\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users\\' freedom is that\\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\\nsource code to the public.\\n\\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\\ncode of the modified version.\\n\\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\\nthis license.\\n\\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\\nmodification follow.\\n\\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\n  0. Definitions.\\n\\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\\n\\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\\n\\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\\n\\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\\n\\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\\non the Program.', metadata={'source': '/home/diego/projects/extern/the-algorithm/COPYING'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\\non the Program.\\n\\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\\n\\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\\n\\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\\n\\n  1. Source Code.\\n\\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\\nform of a work.\\n\\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\\n\\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\\n\\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work\\'s\\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\\n\\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\\nSource.\\n\\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\\nsame work.\\n\\n  2. Basic Permissions.\\n\\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.

You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\\n\\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\\nmakes it unnecessary.\\n\\n  3. Protecting Users\\' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\\n\\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\\nmeasures.\\n\\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work\\'s\\nusers, your or third parties\\' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\\ntechnological measures.\\n\\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\\n\\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program\\'s source code as you\\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\\n\\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\\n\\n  5.

       " Document(page_content=\"# CR-Mixer\\n\\nCR-Mixer is a candidate generation service proposed as part of the Personalization Strategy vision for Twitter. Its aim is to speed up the iteration and development of candidate generation and light ranking. The service acts as a lightweight coordinating layer that delegates candidate generation tasks to underlying compute services. It focuses on Twitter's candidate generation use cases and offers a centralized platform for fetching, mixing, and managing candidate sources and light rankers. The overarching goal is to increase the speed and ease of testing and developing candidate generation pipelines, ultimately delivering more value to Twitter users.\\n\\nCR-Mixer acts as a configurator and delegator, providing abstractions for the challenging parts of candidate generation and handling performance issues. It will offer a 1-stop-shop for fetching and mixing candidate sources, a managed and shared performant platform, a light ranking layer, a common filtering layer, a version control system, a co-owned feature switch set, and peripheral tooling.\\n\\nCR-Mixer's pipeline consists of 4 steps: source signal extraction, candidate generation, filtering, and ranking. It also provides peripheral tooling like scribing, debugging, and monitoring. The service fetches source signals externally from stores like UserProfileService and RealGraph, calls external candidate generation services, and caches results. Filters are applied for deduping and pre-ranking, and a light ranking step follows.\", metadata={'source': '/home/diego/projects/extern/the-algorithm/cr-mixer/README.md'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"# Recos-Injector\\n\\nRecos-Injector is a streaming event processor used to build input streams for GraphJet-based services. It is a general-purpose tool that consumes arbitrary incoming event streams (e.g., Fav, RT, Follow, client_events, etc.), applies filtering, and combines and publishes cleaned up events to corresponding GraphJet services. Each GraphJet-based service subscribes to a dedicated Kafka topic, and Recos-Injector enables GraphJet-based services to consume any event they want.\\n\\n## How to run Recos-Injector server tests\\n\\nYou can run tests by using the following command from your project's root directory:\\n\\n    $ bazel build recos-injector/...\\n    $ bazel test recos-injector/...\\n\\n## How to run recos-injector-server in development on a local machine\\n\\nThe simplest way to stand up a service is to run it locally. To run\\nrecos-injector-server in development mode, compile the project and then\\nexecute it with `bazel run`:\\n\\n    $ bazel build recos-injector/server:bin\\n    $ bazel run recos-injector/server:bin\\n\\nA tunnel can be set up in order for downstream queries to work properly.\\nUpon successful server startup, try to `curl` its admin endpoint in another\\nterminal:\\n\\n    $ curl -s localhost:9990/admin/ping\\n    pong\\n\\nRun `curl -s localhost:9990/admin` to see a list of all available admin endpoints.\\n\\n## Querying Recos-Injector server from a Scala console\\n\\nRecos-Injector does not have a Thrift endpoint. Instead, it reads Event Bus and Kafka queues and writes to the Recos-Injector Kafka.\\n\\n## Generating a package for deployment\\n\\nTo package your service into a zip file for deployment, run:\\n\\n    $ bazel bundle recos-injector/server:bin --bundle-jvm-archive=zip\\n\\nIf the command is successful, a file named `dist/recos-injector-server.zip` will be created.\", metadata={'source': '/home/diego/projects/extern/the-algorithm/recos-injector/README.md'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='Product Mixer\\n=============\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nProduct Mixer is a common service framework and set of libraries that make it easy to build,\\niterate on, and own product surface areas. It consists of:\\n\\n- **Core Libraries:** A set of libraries that enable you to build execution pipelines out of\\n  reusable components. You define your logic in small, well-defined, reusable components and focus\\n  on expressing the business logic you want to have. Then you can define easy to understand pipelines\\n  that compose your components. Product Mixer handles the execution and monitoring of your pipelines\\n  allowing you to focus on what really matters, your business logic.\\n\\n- **Service Framework:** A common service skeleton for teams to host their Product Mixer products.\\n\\n- **Component Library:** A shared library of components made by the Product Mixer Team, or\\n  contributed by users. This enables you to both easily share the reusable components you make as well\\n  as benefit from the work other teams have done by utilizing their shared components in the library.\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\nThe bulk of a Product Mixer can be broken down into Pipelines and Components. Components allow you\\nto break business logic into separate, standardized, reusable, testable, and easily composable\\npieces, where each component has a well defined abstraction. Pipelines are essentially configuration\\nfiles specifying which Components should be used and when. This makes it easy to understand how your\\ncode will execute while keeping it organized and structured in a maintainable way.\\n\\nRequests first go to Product Pipelines, which are used to select which Mixer Pipeline or\\nRecommendation Pipeline to run for a given request. Each Mixer or Recommendation\\nPipeline may run multiple Candidate Pipelines to fetch candidates to include in the response.\\n\\nMixer Pipelines combine the results of multiple heterogeneous Candidate Pipelines together\\n(e.g. ads, tweets, users) while Recommendation Pipelines are used to score (via Scoring Pipelines)\\nand rank the results of homogenous Candidate Pipelines so that the top ranked ones can be returned.\\nThese pipelines also marshall candidates into a domain object and then into a transport object\\nto return to the caller.\\n\\nCandidate Pipelines fetch candidates from underlying Candidate Sources and perform some basic\\noperations on the Candidates, such as filtering out unwanted candidates, applying decorations,\\nand hydrating features.', metadata={'source': '/home/diego/projects/extern/the-algorithm/product-mixer/README.md'}),\n",

      "-> **Question**: What does favCountParams do? \n",

      "**Answer**: `favCountParams` is an optional ThriftLinearFeatureRankingParams object that likely represents the parameters used for ranking or scoring tweets based on their favorite count, which is the number of times a tweet has been favorited or \"liked\" by users. This parameter object might be used in a ranking algorithm to prioritize tweets with higher favorite counts. \n",
      "\n",
      "-> **Question**: is it Likes + Bookmarks, or not clear from the code? \n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer**: It is not clear from the code whether favCountParams represents the sum of Likes and Bookmarks. The code only mentions \"favCount\" without specifying whether it includes both Likes and Bookmarks. \n",
      "\n",
      "-> **Question**: What are the major negative modifiers that lower your linear ranking parameters? \n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer**: In this context, the major negative modifiers that can lower the linear ranking parameters are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. `antigamingPenalty`: A penalty applied to prevent gaming of the ranking system.\n",
      "2. `offensiveTweetPenalty`: A penalty applied to tweets that are deemed offensive.\n",
      "3. `noTextHitDemotion`: A demotion applied when there is no text hit.\n",
      "4. `urlOnlyHitDemotion`: A demotion applied when the hit is based on the URL only.\n",
      "5. `nameOnlyHitDemotion`: A demotion applied when the hit is based on the name only.\n",
      "6. `separateTextAndNameHitDemotion`: A demotion applied when there are separate text and name hits.\n",
      "7. `separateTextAndUrlHitDemotion`: A demotion applied when there are separate text and URL hits.\n",
      "8. `outOfNetworkReplyPenalty`: A penalty applied to out-of-network replies. \n",
      "\n",
      "-> **Question**: How do you get assigned to SimClusters? \n",
      "\n",
      "**Answer**: Tweets are assigned to SimClusters based on the inferred communities and user behavior. The process starts with building user and tweet SimClusters embeddings, which are sparse, interpretable vectors representing users and tweets in the overlapping community space. \n",
      "\n",
      "A Heron job is responsible for building the mapping between SimClusters and tweets. For each SimCluster, the job saves the top 400 tweets, and for each tweet, it saves the top 100 SimClusters. This mapping is based on factors like favorite score and follow score, which are types of tweet scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the embeddings are generated, they are used to make personalized tweet recommendations through the SimClusters ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbors) online serving service. The service utilizes the Approximate Cosine Similarity algorithm to efficiently find tweet candidates that are relevant to the user's interests in the SimCluster space.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, tweets are assigned to SimClusters based on user behavior data and community inference, which are then utilized to generate personalized tweet recommendations. \n",
